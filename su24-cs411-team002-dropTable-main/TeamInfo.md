## Project Summary

Finding a graphics card and CPU for your computer is a time-consuming ordeal that requires you to scour the internet, comparing countless brands and stats. Many people don’t know the first thing when it comes to computer parts, but they will need new parts as their computer ages. Lack of time or knowledge shouldn’t be a barrier keeping someone from replacing the parts on their computer at a fair price, and this project aims to make the task more accessible for all through a streamlined interface. The application features breakdowns of specific CPUs and GPUs as well as layman comparisons between two or more processors of the same category. People can specify variables of interest, such as their dollar budget, their screen resolution or their target FPS, as parameters to be fed to the database. They may also search by brand name or model name of the part.
